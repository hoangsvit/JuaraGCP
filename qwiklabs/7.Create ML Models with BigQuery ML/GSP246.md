# GSP246 - Predict Taxi Fare with a BigQuery ML Forecasting Model

## Task 1. Explore NYC taxi cab data

1. What was the average speed of Yellow taxi trips in 2015?

   ```sql
   #standardSQL
   SELECT
   TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(pickup_datetime,
       MONTH) month,
   COUNT(*) trips
   FROM
   `bigquery-public-data.new_york.tlc_yellow_trips_2015`
   GROUP BY
   1
   ORDER BY
   1
   ```

2. What was the average speed of Yellow taxi trips in 2015?

   ```sql
   #standardSQL
   SELECT
   EXTRACT(HOUR
   FROM
       pickup_datetime) hour,
   ROUND(AVG(trip_distance / TIMESTAMP_DIFF(dropoff_datetime,
           pickup_datetime,
           SECOND))*3600, 1) speed
   FROM
   `bigquery-public-data.new_york.tlc_yellow_trips_2015`
   WHERE
   trip_distance > 0
   AND fare_amount/trip_distance BETWEEN 2
   AND 10
   AND dropoff_datetime > pickup_datetime
   GROUP BY
   1
   ORDER BY
   1
   ```

## Task 2. Identify an objective

## Task 3. Select features and create your training dataset

1. Select features and create your training dataset

   AVG(fare_amount) AS avg_fare,
   STDDEV(fare_amount) AS stddev
   FROM
   `nyc-tlc.yellow.trips`
   # 1,108,779,463 fares
   ```

2. Buang outlier

   ```sql
