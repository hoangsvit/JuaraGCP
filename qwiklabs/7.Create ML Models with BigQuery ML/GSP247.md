# GSP247 - Getting Started with BigQuery Machine Learning

## Task 1. Create a dataset
1. Buat dataset `bqml_lab`


## Task 2. Create a model
1. Buat model
    ```sql
    #standardSQL
    CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `bqml_lab.sample_model`
    OPTIONS(model_type='logistic_reg') AS
    SELECT
        IF(totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label,
        IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
        device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
        IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country,
        IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
    FROM
        `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
    WHERE
        _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170631'
    LIMIT 100000;
    ```


## Task 3. Evaluate the model
1. Evaluate model
    ```sql
    #standardSQL
    SELECT
        *
    FROM
        ml.EVALUATE(MODEL `bqml_lab.sample_model`, (
    SELECT
        IF(totals.transactions IS NULL, 0, 1) AS label,
        IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
        device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
        IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country,
        IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews
    FROM
        `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
    WHERE
        _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'));
     ```


## Task 4. Use the model
1. Predict purchases per country
    ```sql
    #standardSQL
    SELECT
        country,
        SUM(predicted_label) as total_predicted_purchases
    FROM
        ml.PREDICT(MODEL `bqml_lab.sample_model`, (
    SELECT
        IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
        device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
        IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews,
        IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country
    FROM
        `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
    WHERE
        _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'))
    GROUP BY country
    ORDER BY total_predicted_purchases DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```
2. Predict purchases per user
    ```sql
    #standardSQL
    SELECT
        fullVisitorId,
        SUM(predicted_label) as total_predicted_purchases
    FROM
        ml.PREDICT(MODEL `bqml_lab.sample_model`, (
    SELECT
        IFNULL(device.operatingSystem, "") AS os,
        device.isMobile AS is_mobile,
        IFNULL(totals.pageviews, 0) AS pageviews,
        IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country,
        fullVisitorId
    FROM
        `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
    WHERE
        _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20170701' AND '20170801'))
    GROUP BY fullVisitorId
    ORDER BY total_predicted_purchases DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```
