# GSP229 - Predict Visitor Purchases with a Classification Model in BigQuery ML

## Task 1. Explore ecommerce data

1. Run code

   ```sql
   #standardSQL
   WITH visitors AS(
   SELECT
   COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS total_visitors
   FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
   ),
   purchasers AS(
   SELECT
   COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS total_purchasers
   FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
   WHERE totals.transactions IS NOT NULL
   )
   SELECT
       total_visitors,
       total_purchasers,
       total_purchasers / total_visitors AS conversion_rate
   FROM visitors, purchasers
   ```

2. What are the top 5 selling products?

   ```sql
   SELECT
       p.v2ProductName,
       p.v2ProductCategory,
       SUM(p.productQuantity) AS units_sold,
           ROUND(SUM(p.localProductRevenue/1000000),2) AS revenue
   FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`,
   UNNEST(hits) AS h,
   UNNEST(h.product) AS p
   GROUP BY 1, 2
   ORDER BY revenue DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

3. How many visitors bought on subsequent visits to the website?

   ```sql
   # visitors who bought on a return visit (could have bought on first as well
   WITH all_visitor_stats AS (
   SELECT
       fullvisitorid, # 741,721 unique visitors
       IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
       FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
       GROUP BY fullvisitorid
   )
   SELECT
       COUNT(DISTINCT fullvisitorid) AS total_visitors,
       will_buy_on_return_visit
   FROM all_visitor_stats
   GROUP BY will_buy_on_return_visit
   ```

## Task 2. Identify an objective

## Task 3. Select features and create your training dataset

1. What are the risks of only using the above two fields?

    ```sql
    SELECT
    * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
    FROM
    # features
    (SELECT
        fullVisitorId,
        IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
        IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
    FROM
        `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
    WHERE
        totals.newVisits = 1)
    JOIN
    (SELECT
        fullvisitorid,
        IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
    FROM
        `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
    GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
    USING (fullVisitorId)
    ORDER BY time_on_site DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

## Task 4. Create a BigQuery dataset to store models

## Task 5. Select a BigQuery ML model type and specify options
1. Regresi logistik
    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `ecommerce.classification_model`
    OPTIONS
    (
    model_type='logistic_reg',
    labels = ['will_buy_on_return_visit']
    )
    AS
    #standardSQL
    SELECT
    * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
    FROM
    # features
    (SELECT
        fullVisitorId,
        IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
        IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
    FROM
        `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
    WHERE
        totals.newVisits = 1
        AND date BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170430') # train on first 9 months
    JOIN
    (SELECT
        fullvisitorid,
        IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
    FROM
        `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
    GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
    USING (fullVisitorId)
    ;
    ```    

## Task 6. Evaluate classification model performance
1. Evaluate with ROC
    ```sql
    SELECT
    roc_auc,
    CASE
        WHEN roc_auc > .9 THEN 'good'
        WHEN roc_auc > .8 THEN 'fair'
        WHEN roc_auc > .7 THEN 'decent'
        WHEN roc_auc > .6 THEN 'not great'
    ELSE 'poor' END AS model_quality
    FROM
    ML.EVALUATE(MODEL ecommerce.classification_model,  (
    SELECT
    * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
    FROM
    # features
    (SELECT
        fullVisitorId,
        IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
        IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
    FROM
        `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
    WHERE
        totals.newVisits = 1
        AND date BETWEEN '20170501' AND '20170630') # eval on 2 months
    JOIN
    (SELECT
        fullvisitorid,
        IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
    FROM
        `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
    GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
    USING (fullVisitorId)
    ));
    ```

## Task 7. Improve model performance with Feature Engineering
1. Buat model baru
    ```sql
